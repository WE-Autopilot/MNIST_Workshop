## What is MNIST?

The MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning, particularly for image processing and computer vision tasks. It consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels.

- **Training and Testing:** It is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

- **Purpose:** The dataset is commonly used to train and evaluate classification algorithms, serving as a foundational task in deep learning and neural network research.

- **Simplicity:** Its small size and pre-processed, normalized format make it ideal for testing models and concepts with low computational overhead.

Despite being simple, MNIST has inspired more complex variants like Fashion-MNIST for modern use cases.

## What does MNIST have to do with WEAP?

MNIST and WE AutoPilot (WEAP) are connected through their focus on machine learning and AI, which are key aspects of WEAP‚Äôs software development goals, especially in areas like computer vision.

</br>

**1. Understanding Neural Networks:**

- Working with MNIST introduces members to the basics of neural networks, including how models learn from data, optimize weights, and make predictions. By recognizing patterns like handwritten digits in MNIST, members can build a solid foundation for more advanced tasks such as object detection and lane recognition‚Äîcritical components of autonomous vehicle systems.

**2. Hands-On with Machine Learning Frameworks:**

- Members gain experience using popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch while working on MNIST. This practical exposure is directly transferable to projects requiring real-world datasets, such as vehicle navigation or obstacle detection.

**3. Confidence Building:**

- Solving MNIST problems helps new members grasp the logic behind AI and ML systems in a  simple, manageable way. This builds their confidence to dive into more challenging tasks like training models on real-world traffic or environmental data.

**4. Team Collaboration and Mentorship:**

- Members can collaborate on MNIST-related challenges, fostering teamwork and enabling senior members to mentor newcomers on the principles of AI development.

**5. Resume-Worthy Experience:**

- Who doesn‚Äôt want a project showcasing machine learning skills on their resume? A completed MNIST project not only demonstrates technical ability but also signals a willingness to learn and tackle foundational AI problems, making members more attractive to employers in tech and AI industries.

    <p><em>Once you load up the page, click "Download" in top right, and choose your OS</em></p>
</div>
</br>

### 2. Download and Install Python 3.12.x

- Go to the [Python Downloads Page](https://www.python.org/downloads/).

- Scroll down to "Looking for a specific release?"

- Click **Download** on your choice of 3.12.x Python ***(We will be downloading 3.12.8 for this tutorial)***.
   - We are using an older version of Python because you may encounter issues with some library's support for the latest version.

- Scroll to the bottom and choose the installer appropriate for your operating system:
   - **Windows (64-bit):** Select "Windows installer (64-bit)".
   - **Mac:** Select "macOS 64-bit universal2 installer".
   - **Linux:** Follow the instructions provided for your distribution or use the source tarball.

- Run the installer:
   - **Windows:** Check the box for **"Add Python to PATH"** and click **Install Now**.
   - **Mac:** Follow the installation steps.
   - **Linux:** Use your package manager or download the appropriate package.
   
- Verify the installation:
   - Open a terminal or command prompt and type:
     ```ps
     python --version
     ```
     or
     ```ps
     python3 --version
     ```
   - You should see something like `Python 3.12.x`.

</br>

### 3. Install the Python Extension in VS Code

- Open VS Code.

- Go to the Extensions Marketplace:
   - Click the **Extensions** icon on the left sidebar (it looks like four squares).

- Search for **"Python"** in the search bar.

- Select the extension developed by Microsoft and click **Install**.

- Once installed, restart VS Code to ensure the extension loads properly.

</br>

### 4. Set Up Python in VS Code

- Open VS Code and press **Ctrl + Shift + P** (Windows/Linux) or **Cmd + Shift + P** (Mac) to open the Command Palette.

- Type **"Python: Select Interpreter"** and click on it.

- From the list of Python interpreters, select the one corresponding to Python 3.12.x.
   - If you don‚Äôt see it, make sure Python is installed and added to your PATH.

   - Save the file as `hello_world.py` (ensure it has a `.py` extension).

- Write the following code in the file:

   ```python
   print("Hello, World!")
   ```

- Run the Python file:
   - Right-click anywhere in the code editor and select **"Run Python File in Terminal"**.
