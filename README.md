</br>

The MNIST dataset (Modified National Institute of Standards and Technology database) is a widely used benchmark dataset in machine learning, particularly for image processing and computer vision tasks. Think of it like computer vision's "Hello world!". 

The dataset consists of 70,000 grayscale images of handwritten digits (0-9), each of size 28x28 pixels.

- **Training and Testing:** It is divided into 60,000 training images and 10,000 testing images.

- **Purpose:** The dataset is commonly used to train and evaluate classification algorithms, serving as a foundational task in deep learning and neural network research.

- **Simplicity:** Its small size and pre-processed, normalized format make it ideal for testing models and concepts with low computational overhead.

</summary>

</br>

**1. Understanding Neural Networks**

- Learning about neural networks at our workshop provides a hands-on introduction to the foundations of machine learning. You will explore the theory behind how neural networks function, including the role of layers, the concept of a CNN, and the challenges of overfitting. By the end, you will gain a theoretical understanding of AI software engineering and its practical applications in developing intelligent systems.

**2. Hands-On with Machine Learning Frameworks**

- You will gain experience using popular ML frameworks like TensorFlow or PyTorch while working on MNIST. This practical exposure is directly transferable to projects requiring real-world datasets, such as vehicle navigation or obstacle detection.

**3. Confidence Building:**

- Solving MNIST problems helps you grasp the logic behind AI and ML systems in a simple, manageable way. This builds you confidence to dive into more challenging tasks like training models on real-world traffic or environmental data.

**4. A Machine Learning Project YOU made!**

- Who doesn‚Äôt want a project showcasing machine learning skills on their resume? A completed MNIST project not only demonstrates technical ability but also signals a willingness to learn and tackle foundational AI problems, making you more attractive to employers in tech and AI industries.

<h3 style="display: inline; border-bottom: none;">7. Set Up a Python Virtual Environment (Highly Recommended)</h3>
</summary>

A virtual environment helps isolate your Python projects, ensuring that dependencies for one project don‚Äôt conflict with others. This is especially useful when working with machine learning libraries that may have version-specific requirements.

#### Windows

1. **Install `virtualenv`**:
   ```ps
   pip install virtualenv
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   Navigate to your project folder, then in the terminal or command prompt and run:
   ```ps
   virtualenv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```ps
   .\venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

4. **Verify activation**:
   You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating the environment is active.

#### MacOS/Linux

1. **Install `virtualenv`**:
   ```bash
   pip3 install virtualenv
   ```

2. **Create a virtual environment**:
   Navigate to your project folder in the terminal and run:
   ```bash
   virtualenv venv
   ```

3. **Activate the virtual environment**:
   ```bash
   source venv/bin/activate
   ```

4. **Verify activation**:
   You should see `(venv)` at the beginning of your terminal prompt, indicating the environment is active.

#### Why Virtual Environments?

- **Dependency Management**: Keeps project dependencies isolated, avoiding version conflicts.
- **Portability**: Makes it easier to share projects without worrying about global Python package versions.
- **Clean Development Environment**: Prevents clutter in your global Python installation.

> **Tip**: To deactivate the environment, type:
> ```bash
> deactivate
> ```

<h3 style="display: inline; border-bottom: none;">8. Install Git and Set Up a Repository (Recommended)</h3>
</summary>

Version control is a key skill for any developer. Git allows you to track changes, collaborate effectively, and revert to previous versions of your code when needed.

#### Windows

1. **Download and install Git**:
   - Visit the [Git website](https://git-scm.com/) and download the installer.
   - Run the installer and follow the default setup instructions.
   - Ensure the option **"Add Git to PATH"** is selected during installation.

2. **Verify the installation**:
   Open a command prompt and type:
   ```ps
   git --version
   ```

#### MacOS/Linux

1. **Install Git**:
   - On MacOS:
     Use homebrew:
     ```bash
     brew install git
     ```

    If you don't have homebrew installed run the following in your terminal:
   ```bash
   /bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
   ```
   
   - On Linux:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install git
     ```

1. **Verify the installation**:
   ```bash
   git --version
   ```

#### Set Up a Repository

1. **Initialize a Git repository**:
   In your project folder, run:
   ```bash
   git init
   ```

2. **Add files to the repository**:
   ```bash
   git add .
   ```

3. **Commit your changes**:
   ```bash
   git commit -m "Initial commit"
   ```

4. **Link to a remote repository (e.g., GitHub)**:
   - Create a new repository on GitHub.
   - Copy the repository URL and run:
     ```bash
     git remote add origin <repository-url>
     git branch -M main
     git push -u origin main
     ```

> **Tip**: Git is essential for collaborating on projects and keeping a reliable history of your work. Your best bet to become skillful at Git is practice and some tutorial videos on YouTube.
